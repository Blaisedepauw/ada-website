Hello, everyone! Welcome to our class on globalization. I know that globalization can sometimes seem like a vast and complex topic, filled with economic jargon and cultural theory. However, today, I'm excited to introduce you to a way of understanding globalization that is as engaging as it is enlightening: through the lens of cinema.

As someone who has always been passionate about films, I find that cinema is an incredible medium for exploring the forces that shape our world. Movies not only entertain us but also reflect the economic, cultural, and social shifts that define globalization. By analyzing films, we can gain insights into how interconnected our world has become and how cultures intermingle and influence one another.

Throughout this course, we'll engage in a dynamic dialogue (I really encourage your participation !), where we'll dissect movies to uncover the deeper narratives of globalization. 

We'll start by examining the economic side of globalization in the film industry. This includes looking at co-productions and box office trends that mirror global trade and economic alliances. Then, we'll venture into the cultural realm, exploring how film genres and iconic characters cross borders and contribute to cultural exchanges. Finally, we'll consider the diversity of actors, highlighting how global mobility and migration influence the stories we see on screen.

My hope is that by the end of this course, you'll see globalization not just as an abstract concept, but as a living, breathing process that cinema both reflects and shapes. So, let's dive into this cinematic journey and discover the profound connections between film and globalization. I'm excited to see where this exploration takes us and to hear your thoughts and insights along the way. Let's get started!
