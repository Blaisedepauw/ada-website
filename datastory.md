# Introduction {#intro}

**Professor:**
>Hello, everyone! Welcome to Seattle for my class on globalization, my name is Professor Knowbalization and I'll be your teacher today. I know that globalization can sometimes seem like a vast and complex topic, filled with economic jargon and cultural theory. However, today, I'm excited to introduce you to a way of understanding globalization that is as engaging as it is enlightening: through the lens of cinema.
>
>Throughout this course, we'll engage in a dynamic dialogue (I really encourage your participation !), where we'll dissect movies to uncover the deeper narratives of globalization:\\
>At its essence, globalization is about increasing interconnectedness across the globe. Economically, it involves the free flow of money, goods, and services between nations. Culturally, it reflects the exchange of ideas, traditions, and creativity across borders. And for populations, globalization is about mobility, as people migrate and interact on a global scale, shaping diverse and dynamic societies.
>
>As someone who has always been passionate about films, I'm conviced that movies not only entertain us but also reflect the economic, cultural, and social shifts that define globalization. By analyzing films, we can gain insights into how interconnected our world has become and how cultures intermingle and influence one another.
>
>My hope is that by the end of this course, you'll see globalization not just as an abstract concept, but as a living, breathing process that cinema both reflects and shapes. So, let's dive into this cinematic journey and discover the profound connections between film and globalization. I'm excited to see where this exploration takes us and to hear your thoughts and insights along the way. Let's get started!


# I/ Economy {#part-1}

### I.1 Free exchanges of goods and services

**Professor:**
>In this course, we will first address the economic aspect of globalization. Let's begin with a definition to set the context, and then I will show you how the film industry serves as a witness to economic globalization. Do you have any questions before we start?

**Jason the Troublemaker:**
>Sir, are you going to talk about Marvel movies? I am a big fan of the Avengers!

**Professor:**
>Funny you mention that,  Jason, because Marvel movies are an excellent example for our discussion on cinema!
Economic globalization can be defined as the global acceleration of the exchange of goods and services, facilitated by the gradual removal of trade barriers, starting with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1948 and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, alongside advancements in transportation and communication. When you watch a Marvel movie at a cinema in Lausanne, you are participating in the global economy by paying for a film produced in the United States.

**Ada:**
>How can we measure the economic market of the film industry? If the film industry reflects economic globalization, does that mean there is an increasing amount of money being exchanged?

**Professor:**
>Thank you for your question! To build on my response to Jason, I will use the box office revenue generated by the film industry between 1914 and 2012 as an economic indicator. As you suspect, we should see an upward trend.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include Rev_vs_Adj_Rev_Worldwide.html %}
</div>

>On the graph, the blue curve represents the box office revenue of the film industry in billions of dollars. The orange curve, on the other hand, shows the box office revenue adjusted for inflation, using 1963 as the reference year. The orange curve gives you an idea of the “real” market growth by taking into account the effects of inflation. As you suspected,  Ada, we can observe a growth in the film market starting in the 1980s, which accelerated significantly after 1995, coinciding with the WTO agreements.
 
**Jason the Troublemaker:**
>Given all the money the film industry generates, it must be seriously globalized!

**Professor:**
>It's not quite that simple, Jason. When discussing globalization, it's important to consider the scale, whether countries or continents are well integrated into the rest of the world. To explore this, we will look at whether individual countries are well-integrated into the film economy and whether they also follow the growth trend we observed on a global scale. I will let you examine the following two graphs to see whether all countries are equally integrated into the film industry from an economic perspective. For clarity, you can focus directly on the interactive graph of world regions. What observations can you make?

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include Rev-vs-Adj_Rev_country.html %}
</div>

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include Rev-vs-Adj_Rev_region.html %}
</div>

**Ada:**
>For North America, we see that box office revenue growth starts as early as the 1880s, while in Europe, growth only becomes evident around 1995. For other regions of the world, it’s harder to identify clear trends. I also noticed a drop in revenue starting in 2010 for both North America and Europe.

**Professor:**
>Thank you for this insightful analysis. Regarding the decline in revenue after 2010, don’t worry, it’s simply due to the fact that I couldn’t gather enough films for my analyses from that point onward. Now, as for the gap between the United States and Europe, it’s fascinating because it aligns with the idea that the United States experienced an early global economic boom. Then, WTO agreements facilitated the free exchange of goods and services worldwide, economically benefiting Europe, which experienced a later growth phase. Finally, our example also illustrates that the integration of different regions into globalization is an unequal process that happens at varying speeds.

**Jason the Troublemaker:**
>So we can say that only the United States and Europe are globalized, right?

**Professor:**
>Not exactly. We need to take a step back from our cinema example, it’s not necessarily representative of all goods and services exchanged within the framework of globalization. That said, I will now show you a world map that graphically illustrates how the entire world has economically integrated into this globalized industry.
>
>On this map, you can see the market shares of the film industry in terms of revenue. I used a logarithmic scale to balance the weight of the United States and allow you to clearly identify the emergence of other countries in the global market. You can use the slider to explore different years and observe that, as early as the 1960s, countries other than the United States began to carve out a place in the global market, a reflection of the GATT agreements. Over time, more and more countries gained significant market shares in the film industry, which is evidence of globalization.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include Rev_Market-share.html %}
</div>

### I.2 Co-productions evolution

**Ada:**
>Sir, you defined globalization as an economic exchange between countries. However, a gradual increase in the integration of countries into the global film market doesn’t necessarily imply interaction between them.

**Professor:**
>Once again, thank you, Ada, for this very astute observation. The nuance you raise is crucial because, indeed, all countries could have developed independently within closed economies. This is why we will now focus on co-productions, which are clear evidence of economic exchange between countries.
>
>In the following graph, you can observe, for different countries, the inflation-adjusted box office revenue over the years alongside the number of co-productions per year for those same countries.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include Rev_vs_Co-prod.html %}
</div>

**Jason the Troublemaker:**
>This whole co-production thing still isn’t very clear to me. Are you sure it’s relevant?

**Professor:**
>Thank you for your critical thinking, Jason ! I am not sure if it’s because you’re feeling rebellious today or because, for once, you’re particularly engaged now that we’re talking about Marvel movies. Either way, I am glad to see you participating so much!
>
>Indeed, from the last graph, it’s hard to draw any quick conclusions since an increase in the number of co-productions isn’t always correlated with an increase or decrease in box office revenue. That’s why we will now examine the evolution of co-productions on a global scale to determine whether our hypothesis of expanding yet self-contained economies holds up. So, what are your thoughts on this?

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include Co-prod_countries.html %}
</div>

**Ada:**
>From the graph, we can observe a significant evolution in the number of co-productions between countries over the last century. In the early 1940s, we saw the first trend emerge between the United States and Europe. From the 1950s onward, this trend strengthened between Western blocs and expanded to include a generalization of co-productions on a global scale. By 2012, it’s evident that many countries are integrated into the film economy, making it globalized in line with the definition you provided at the beginning of the course.

**Professor:**
>Once again, thank you for your insightful analysis. I am accustomed to seeing you engaged in class, but today you’ve exceeded my expectations. In the end, this cinema example seems to captivate all of you, which is fantastic news!
>
>As you explained, this graph clearly demonstrates that the film economy is globalized, as it integrates numerous countries into this industry. Notably, we observe major hubs such as North America, Europe, Australia, and parts of Asia (China, India, Japan) that are particularly well-integrated.
>
>Initially, we discussed how globalization occurs at varying speeds, and this map also highlights its unequal nature, as some countries remain excluded from the global economic framework.
>
>To conclude this segment and provide you with a more detailed understanding of the economic globalization process, I’d like you to analyze this final map. It overlays countries' revenues with their integration into the global economy through their number of co-productions.
>
>For better readability, I’ve chosen to represent the evolution in ten-year intervals, starting from 1920 through 2010. This will allow you to identify the decades during which economic globalization in the film industry intensified.
>
>You will notice that in the early years, the United States, with Hollywood, served as the cradle of the film industry. By the 1950s, Europe gradually integrated, followed by Asia, with India and the rise of Bollywood playing a significant role. From then on, global relations between these three continents intensified, contributing to the industry's growth.
>
>Later, starting in the 1970s, Australia joined this economy, followed by Africa and South America in the 1980s. Additionally, the 2000s show a peak in activity for the globalized film industry.

# II/ Culture {#part-2}

### II.1 Genre analysis

**Jason the Troublemaker:** 
>Sir, you've been talking to us about cinema, numbers, economics, and exchanges all this time. But what’s your favorite type of movie?

**Professor:** 
>Ah, well, since Jason is actually taking an interest in my class for once, I’ll answer him. My favorite type of movie is art-house films, like Metropolis! A film that came out in 1927.

**Jason the Troublemaker:** 
>Nobody knows that! You don’t even watch Marvel movies or, I don’t know, science fiction?

**Professor:** 
>Of course, I do, just like everyone else. In fact, it’s a great way to understand how globalization has influenced the diversity of film genres. Any thoughts on this?

**Ada:** 
>As we can imagine, over time, film genres have traveled across the globe, and countries have influenced one another. That’s why today, everyone rushes to see the latest Avengers movie, and nobody cares about specialized cinema anymore.

**Professor:**
>Well, you’re not entirely wrong, but you’re not completely correct either. To understand the evolution of film genres, I propose we first analyze the most popular genres throughout history. To do this, I’ll use my film database and count the number of films produced by genre. Of course, some films belong to multiple genres, so we’ll count each film once per genre. Look at the following histogram, what do you notice?

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include most_common_genres.html %}
</div>

**Jason the Troublemaker:** 
>Your art-house films aren’t even there!

**Ada:**
>We notice that the most popular or at least the most represented genres are Drama, Comedy, Romance, and Crime. Why are black-and-white films included in the ranking, sir?

**Professor:**
>Great question. That’s because this count spans the entire history of cinema, starting from the 1890s. Back then, films weren’t in color. It wasn’t until the 1950s that color films began to be produced, and even then, people didn’t have color televisions. What’s noteworthy here is that some genres are much more prominent than others. Fun fact: only two films in my database belong to the ‘Neorealism’ category. However, keep in mind this might also be due to missing data or the fact that niche genres are less well-known and perhaps not cataloged.

**Ada:**
>Sir, if you’re considering the entire history of cinema, how have the dominant genres evolved over time?

**Professor:** 
>I have a graph you might like. By grouping the data by genre and year, I calculated the cumulative number of films for each genre over time. Using this data, I created a bar race plot that shows the evolution of the top 10 genres over time.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include top_10_genres_by_year.html %}
</div>

>Over time, the most trending genres have evolved significantly. From 1900 to 1930, cinema was primarily dominated by silent, short, black-and-white films. Starting in the 1930s, Drama and Comedy began to emerge, steadily climbing to the top of the rankings. You weren’t born yet, but between 1943 and 1964, we witnessed the golden age of musicals, which entered the top 10 dominant genres. By 1980, Action and Adventure films started making their way into the top ranks, and in the 2000s, we also saw the rise of Crime films and global cinema.
>
>What we need to understand to connect this to globalization is: where do these genres come from? Where did they first emerge? To answer this question, I’ve prepared a graph showing, for each film genre, the country and the year in which it first appeared.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include timeline_genres.html %}
</div>

>Here, we can see that new genres have emerged almost every year since the dawn of cinema. Even more interestingly, it is in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom where the highest number of new genres first appeared. In fact, this is where some of the world’s most popular genres, such as Drama, Comedy, and Thriller, were initially developed.
>
>While the connection to globalization isn’t direct, it’s worth noting that these countries were pioneers in creating new film genres. On the following histogram, I’ve provided a breakdown by country.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include genre_apparition_count_by_country.html %}
</div>


>Out of the 362 genres in the database, approximately 70% originated in the USA, 10% in the UK, 9% in France, and 7% in Germany. These countries belong to highly globalized economic regions, making it interesting to examine more closely how film production by genre has been distributed over time across different parts of the world. Can someone tell me what they observe in the next graph regarding the top genres mentioned earlier?

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include interactive_genre_region_plot.html %}
</div>

**Ada:**
>The graphs confirm what I had intuitively thought. For the Drama genre, we can see that the United States is the first to produce films of this kind, followed by European countries. Then, Asian countries, and finally South American and African countries, also start producing dramas. The same pattern can be observed for comedies and thrillers. So, there seems to be a kind of wave phenomenon happening here.

**Professor:**
>Excellent observation! What you’re describing aligns perfectly with the concept of cultural globalization. Indeed, the spread of film genres, such as drama, comedy, or thriller, follows a wave-like dynamic. This process often begins in the United States, which has had a highly influential film industry thanks to Hollywood since the early 20th century, particularly from the 1920s-1930s with the rise of talkies.
>
>Next, European countries adopt these genres, especially after World War II during the 1950s-1960s, when Europe began developing its own productions, while still influenced by the United States. Later, Asian countries join this trend, for instance, with the rise of Indian cinema (Bollywood) in the 1970s, as well as the global success of Japanese and Korean cinema in the 1990s-2000s.
>
>Finally, South American and African countries also embrace these genres, particularly from the 2000s onward, as local film industries grow, often supported by new technologies and the globalization of media. This process exemplifies the global circulation of cultural models, where genres or styles spread from one region to another, often Adapting to local cultural specificities along the way.
>
>Thus, this "wave phenomenon" you’ve noticed in the graphs is a clear manifestation of cultural globalization, where local productions emerge in response to global influences. To confirm this, I’ve prepared pie charts showing the top 5 genres by region of the world.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include interactive_genre_region_pie.html %}
</div>

**Jason the Troublemaker:**
>Oh, pizza!

**Professor:**
>Yes, that’s exactly right, Jason! But more seriously, these charts show us that, while some genres like Drama dominate globally across all regions, there are still marked cultural specificities. In East Asia, for instance, we see a strong presence of films centered around Japanese or Chinese themes, genres that reflect specific cultural traditions, just as Bollywood represents South Asia.
>
>Meanwhile, Africa and the Middle East stand out with a notable share of documentaries and global cinema, even though these genres remain secondary. In North America, comedies play a major role, while in Oceania and Europe, there is significant diversity, with a strong proportion of global cinema alongside comedies.
>
>These variations highlight that, despite cultural globalization, some regions maintain distinct preferences shaped by their cultural and historical contexts.

**Ada:** 
>But in the end, does globalization lead to cultural diversification or unification?

**Professor:** 
>That’s the heart of the question regarding globalization. On the one hand, advances in communication strengthen cultural diversity by giving new visibility to minority cultures and fostering intercultural dialogue. On the other hand, globalization encourages the emergence of a shared culture dominated by global references, often characterized by the use of English and the spread of Western cultural standards, which raises concerns about uniformity and cultural impoverishment.
>
>To explore this, I’ve calculated a cultural diversity score for each region of the world over time. This score is based on two factors: genre richness, which measures the number of genres present in a region, and genre distribution, which uses the Gini index to assess the balance in the distribution of films across genres. A lower Gini index indicates a more equal distribution and increases the score. The final score combines these two aspects into a single measure that reflects both the variety and balance of genres for each region and time period.
>
>Does anyone have an idea about how we could analyze these results?

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include diversity_score_evolution_by_region.html %}
</div>

**Ada:** 
>We can see that several trends emerge depending on the region of the world, reflecting different patterns of evolution.

**Professor:** 
>Exactly. In terms of diversity, there are several phases that mark the different regions. In Europe and North America, we observe an increase in cultural diversity between 1900 and 1930, followed by stabilization during the 1930s and 1940s, and then a slight decline starting in the 1980s. This evolution first reflects a period of openness driven by migration, trade, and the emergence of media, which later gave way to cultural homogenization associated with globalization. The dominance of certain Western cultures gradually encouraged a process of standardization.
>
>In Southeast Asia, these same phases occur later, starting in the 1940s and 1950s, due to the region’s delayed integration into globalization, influenced by specific historical, political, and economic factors. Generally speaking, these staggered rhythms are also observed in Africa, Central Asia, and South America, where cultural and economic diversification intensified primarily between 1950 and 1970 but was often hindered by limited infrastructure or economic dependencies. Cinema, as a witness to these developments, highlights these inequalities of integration by showing how some local cultures resist standardization while others more readily adopt elements of global culture.
>
>Did everyone understand?

**Ada:** 
>Yes, sir!

**Jason the Troublemaker:** 
>Yeah... well, no, but yes!

**Professor:** 
>I have one last map to show you. This time, I’ve represented, by country, the genre that has been the most produced since the beginning of cinema. It’s simply a matter of grouping the data by genre and country, then applying a counter. Take a look at this beautiful map and tell me what you think.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include most_common_genre_per_country.html %}
</div>

**Jason the Troublemaker:** 
>The world is red, sir!

**Ada:** 
>I’d say the world is dramatic!

**Professor:** 
>That's true! With this map, we can understand two main things. First, most countries in the world predominantly produce dramatic films, including the United States, Canada, and China, where drama ranks in the top 3. This reflects a certain cultural unification, a consequence of globalization, where global trends seem to have standardized cinematic preferences. Second, some countries, like China or a few African nations, stand out by producing predominantly other genres, showing that local specificities persist and resist global influences.
>
>Finally, it’s important to note that, despite these similarities in major productions, films produced in smaller quantities, often independent or regional, continue to reflect unique cultural identities. These works explore local themes and less conventional genres, contributing to the preservation of cultural diversity and offering a valuable counterpoint to global uniformity. Any questions? … No questions? Great, I’ll continue!
>

### II.2 Topic modeling

>Now, I’d like to move on to a section of the course where we explore whether certain topics addressed in films are common across various parts of the world. For this, I’ve done some Topic Modeling. I had access to a large number of film summaries, and I used the BERTopic library to extract recurring themes from these summaries, allowing me to assign a topic to each summary with a certain probability. This enables us to categorize films with a new feature!

**Ada:** 
>So, what recurring themes did you find?

**Professor:** 
>Well, among the recurring themes identified, we have universal topics like Love & Family, or popular genres like Crime and Investigation. Some topics reflect specific historical or cultural contexts, such as WWII, Samurai, or Civil War. Others, lighter or linked to collective imagination, include themes like Cartoons, Fantasy, or Martial Arts. Finally, some topics evoke iconic figures or significant elements, like Disney, Godzilla, or Royalty. This shows that, despite cultural differences, some themes resonate globally, while others remain deeply rooted in local traditions or histories.
>
>I’ve also calculated some basic statistics to give you an overview.

<div style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
        <tr>
            <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Statistic</th>
            <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Average number of countries per topic</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">20.75</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Average number of regions per topic</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">5.85</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Average number of movies per topic</td>
            <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">463.40</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

>We can see that each topic is present on average in 20.75 countries and spans 5.85 regions, showing an international reach. On average, each topic covers 463.40 films, with some themes, like Love & Family or Fantasy, surpassing geographical borders, while others, like Samurai or Yakuza, remain more localized.

**Jason the Troublemaker:** 
>Sir, I don’t like math, I prefer maps!

**Professor:** 
>Lucky for you, I’ve prepared some maps for certain topics. Take a look and tell me what you notice!

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include topic_world_map.html %}
</div>

**Ada:** 
>Once again, we can see that the topics cross borders. For example, Samurai films are talked about in China, but also in Europe and the United States. We also see that films about Africa are not just produced in Africa but also in Europe, America, and China.

**Professor:** 
>Exactly! By looking at these maps, we observe the emergence of three main poles: North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia. This clearly illustrates how globalization fosters cultural exchanges between these regions. On the other hand, some other regions seem less integrated into these global flows, producing fewer films or remaining more focused on their own local contexts. This shows that globalization, while a global phenomenon, does not affect all regions equally, thus creating disparities in access to cultural exchanges. Any questions?

### II.3 US cultural influence

**Ada:**
>Sir, everyone knows that the United States are the leaders of globalization. So, if we want to know if a country is well integrated into globalization, we just need to look at its links with the United States, right?


**Professor:**
>An excellent point, Ada! And you know what? Cinema is actually a great way to explore this idea. Perhaps you’re not entirely wrong… Let’s look into it together.
So, how can we quantify the links, or rather the cultural influence of the United States on other countries in the film industry? For this analysis, we will rely on film summaries, as they often reflect key themes, characters, and locations.


**Jason the Troublemaker:**
>Ah, you’re going to talk about complicated statistics again, right?


**Professor:**
>Not at all, Jason! We’ll use a technique called zero-shot classification. This is a method in natural language processing (NLP) that allows a model to assign categories to a text, even if the model has never been specifically trained on these categories.
Using the HuggingFace Transformers library, we will classify the film summaries with a label, here "United States". This will give us a score, which will allow us to measure the extent to which a film is associated with American cultural influence.
Once we have an influence score for each film, we can average these scores for each country. This gives us a measure of the American cultural influence across the entire film production of a country.


**Ada:**
>So, if I understand correctly, the higher the average score, the more culturally influenced a country is by the United States in its films?


**Professor:**
>Exactly, Ada! Now, let’s see what this reveals. Let’s explore whether this influence has any connection with a country’s cinematic productivity.


<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include oscatterplot.html %}
</div>

>Interestingly, we observe that, on average, the largest film producers tend to offer films more influenced by the United States than others. The two variables appear to be correlated, with an R² of 0.23 and a p-value of 6*10⁻⁷, suggesting a statistically significant relationship. This implies that being closer to American themes may help develop a more influential film industry.
Of course, I’m sure you’re curious to know which countries have the films most influenced by the United States.
Let’s group them by geographic region and observe the positioning of each region in this boxplot:

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include US_influence_region.html %}
</div>

>At first glance, the regions of the world with the highest scores indeed seem to be the most integrated into globalization. However, be careful not to group everyone together!
We can observe, in this boxplot, significant disparities in certain geographic areas (for example, in Europe). This geographical cluster-based observation gives us a first insight into the relationship between globalization and U.S. influence in the film industry, but I think it would be interesting to consider another method of clustering the countries to better understand the link between the two.
>
>I have an idea, students! We’ve seen that the volume of film production in a country can be an indicator of its integration into globalization. Let’s cluster our countries based on two features: the number of films produced by the country and the U.S. influence score.
>
>For this, I suggest using KMeans clustering (after standardizing the features, of course).
By using the silhouette score, we identify 3 main clusters:

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include silhouette_score.html %}
</div>


<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include Kmeans.html %}
</div>

>**Cluster 0: The Discreet Independents**\\
>These countries produce few films and show low American influence in their productions. They are the "cinema craftsmen" who often prefer local stories, narratives rooted in their culture, or low-budget projects. They stand out for their creative independence and a lack of Hollywood themes or styles. In these countries, cinema is sometimes more of a means of cultural expression than a mass industry.
>
>**Cluster 1: The Balanced Explorers**\\
>Countries in this cluster produce a moderate number of films and show a more noticeable American influence, but not a dominant one. They fall into an intermediate zone where their cinema blends local and global elements. One could say these countries explore "cultural bridges": their productions strike a balance between telling local stories and borrowing codes or inspiration from the American film industry. This leads to a diversity of creative approaches, often appreciated on the international stage.
>
>**Cluster 2: The Budding Hollywoods**\\
>Here, we find the major film producers heavily marked by American influence. These countries are followers of the "blockbuster" style with themes, techniques, and sometimes even actors or directors directly inspired by Hollywood. These film industries aim to compete with the United States on the global stage by combining commercial ambition with wide accessibility for an international audience.
>
>
>Let’s observe the distribution of these clusters across the world’s regions.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include Cluster_Wregion.html %}
</div>

>Well, all these observations are very interesting, but now it's time to answer our dear Ada. Here, I’ve compared the clusters we've identified with an official globalization indicator. For this, we will use the Made in Switzerland indicator from ETH Zurich, the KOF.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include Map_cluster.html %}

>Our clustering doesn’t provide as smooth a gradient as the map from the KOF, but we do observe many similarities between the two maps. Therefore, we've managed to obtain a map quite similar to the one produced by official globalization indices, thanks to the measure of the cultural influence of the United States!
>
>You were right in your intuition... While this isn’t enough to precisely determine a country’s integration into globalization, the cultural influence of the United States in a country’s film productions gives us a good indication of its integration into globalization.

### II.4 Character study for cultural influence analysis

**Jason the Troublemaker:**
>Sir, you said that globalization includes cultural exchanges, but I don’t understand. Culture isn’t exchanged like money! It doesn’t make sense…

**Professor:**
>That’s a great point, Jason. It’s true that cultural exchange is less obvious to grasp than economic exchange. But you know me, I’m going to give you a concrete example. Tell me, Jason, what’s your favorite movie character?

**Jason the Troublemaker:**
>James Bond, sir. He’s so cool!

**Professor:** 
>I agree, Jason, James Bond has an unmatched style. But you know, he’s also a great example of cultural exchange. Through the 007 films, the British convey elements of their culture: their dry humor, their love of tea, their elegance, and even a unique vision of spies. And what’s fascinating is that these elements become more familiar and acceptable to us because they are carried by a character we admire.\\
>In other words, through characters like James Bond, British cultural aspects travel and integrate into our collective representations. It’s as if, without realizing it, we “adopt” a part of that culture. That’s why movie characters are such a great starting point to study cultural exchanges between countries. What do you think, Jason?

**Jason the Troublemaker:** 
>I see what you mean now, sir. I’m listening.

**Professor:** 
>Very well, let’s talk about characters! To quantify cultural exchanges between countries, here’s what I propose: we will assign each character an origin country, that is, the culture they come from. Then, we will analyze in which other countries’ films that character appears. This will allow us to measure how well a country is able to transmit its culture through its characters.\\
>In other words, the more a character from a specific culture appears in productions from other countries, the more it shows the cultural influence of that country around the world. Simple, right?


<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include Distribution_character.html %}
</div>

>Very well, let’s continue! We have identified 960 characters appearing in multiple films. On average, these characters participate in productions from 1.8 different countries, with a maximum of 8 countries for some.\\
>However, for this analysis, we are only interested in the 427 characters that appear in productions from different countries. For each country that has produced a film featuring a given character, we assign 1 character influence point to the character’s country of origin. This gives us a total of 771 points to distribute.
>
>Let’s get to the heart of the matter: how do we assign an origin country to a character? A simple, yet naive, approach would be to say that a character’s country of origin is the one from the first film they appear in. Let’s see what this gives us for the most popular character: Cardinal Richelieu.
>
>A historical and cultural figure par excellence in France, according to this logic, he would become a Hispanic-American-English character. You see the problem. 

<img src="assets/img/cardinal.jpg" alt="Fullscreen Image" style="max-width: 20%; display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: auto;">

>We need to think this through, kids. To overcome these inconsistencies, we will reuse the zero-shot classification method, which we previously used to analyze the cultural influence of the United States through movie summaries. This time, we’ll apply it directly to the characters.
>
>In practice, we submit the name of each character to an NLP model that assigns a score to several labels representing different countries. The country with the highest score then becomes the character’s country of origin.
>
>By using this method, we can move beyond the limitations of naive approaches and provide a more precise and coherent analysis, relying on natural language processing models capable of capturing nuances that are sometimes invisible to the human eye.
>
>I know, kids, this involves a lot of techniques. But trust me, it’s worth it!
Now, let’s determine where the most influential characters come from! The horizontal bar plot below shows the evolution of the countries that are the origin of the most influential characters. Each unit represents one character influence point.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include Top10_character.html %}
</div>

>Phew, we almost saw a rise in the United States' influence in the 2000s! But the British still hold the lead with a total of 283 character influence points, closely followed by the United States with 274 points. Far behind, Canada has accumulated 34 points. 
>
>Thanks to James Bond, who appears in productions from 6 different countries!

<img src="assets/img/james.jpg" alt="Fullscreen Image" style="max-width: 40%; display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: auto;">

**Professor:** 
>But I know you, you're curious! You want to know which movie characters are the most influential? Here's a top 4 of characters who appear in productions from more than 6 different countries.

<img src="assets/img/podium.png" alt="Podium image" style="max-width: 40%; display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: auto;">

>As you can see, we've found the real Cardinal Richelieu, thanks to NLP!
>
>Ah, Count Dracula, one of the most iconic characters in literature and cinema. He has been attributed to Romania, his country of origin, and for good reason: the vampire myth finds its roots in the legends of Transylvania, a historical region of Romania.
>
>Mina Harker, although she appears in Dracula, is undeniably British. She was born and raised in England, embodies Victorian values, and her actions in the story, as well as her role as Jonathan Harker’s wife, fit into a distinctly British cultural framework.
>
>Finally, let’s talk about Oliver Twist, the hero of Charles Dickens' famous novel. Again, the United Kingdom is the obvious choice. Indeed, Oliver Twist, a young orphaned boy, is a symbol of the harsh realities of industrial England.


# III/ Population {#part-3}

### III.1 Increase in the diversity of origins

**Professor:** 
>In this last part of the class, we will discuss how globalization impacts populations.

**Jason the Troublemaker:** 
>Does it mean that countries exchange their inhabitants like they exchange products? That seems a bit strange…

**Professor:** 
>Indeed, that would be strange! But it’s not exactly what I meant. As the world becomes more global, it becomes easier for people to migrate or travel to different countries. Let’s take a look at the figure below. In this figure, each bar represents the number of actors in a single year, and the different colors show the country of origin of the actors. There is also a normalized version that displays the percentages of each country of origin within the total number of actors.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include proportion_ethnicity.html %}
</div>

**Professor:** 
>This graph conveys two pieces of information. First, if we look at the original version, we can see that the overall number of actors has increased over time, which aligns with the increase observed in the number of movies. Second, when we look at the normalized version, we notice that some countries represent an increasingly important proportion of actors, such as India, China, and South Korea. Meanwhile, others have seen their proportion decrease, like the United States and Canada.

**Ada:** 
>Excuse me, sir, but there’s something I don’t quite understand! It seems that this histogram, on its own, is more of an indicator of the development of countries than of their globalization. It shows that the main players in the movie industry have shifted, from Northern countries to Southern countries, but it doesn’t provide direct information about globalization.

**Professor:** 
>You are absolutely correct! To visualize globalization, we must show that these increasing numbers of ethnicities do not exist in isolation but rather participate together in common movies. To demonstrate this, let’s examine the evolution of diversity in films. Jason, can you describe the following graph?

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include average_ethnicity_per_movie.html %}
</div>

**Jason the Troublemaker:** 
>We can see a blue curve that rises, with light blue lines around it. The lines also get bigger over time. But what do they represent?

**Professor:** 
>Good observation, Jason! The blue curve represents the average number of ethnicities per movie, and you can see how it evolves over time, it increases. The light blue lines indicate the standard deviations. Overall, the mean number of ethnicities per movie has increased! The increasing size of the standard deviation means that some movies are becoming very diverse in terms of actor origin, while others remain much less diversified.

**Ada:** 
>So, if we link both graphs, we can observe that actors come from increasingly diverse origins and that these diverse origins are increasingly mixed within movies. This demonstrates that globalization also affects populations. Did I get that right?

### III.2 International careers

**Professor:** 
>Yes, that’s exactly what I wanted you to understand. Well done! Now let’s examine another fascinating aspect: international careers. Can you name an actor you like?

**Jason the Troublemaker:** 
>Jackie Chan!

**Professor:** 
>Excellent example. Jackie Chan originates from Hong Kong but has acted in movies produced by the United States, France, China, India, and other countries. This is an example of an international career made possible by globalization! Now, take a look at this map. When two countries are connected by a line, it means that an actor has worked in both countries. The width of the line represents the number of actors. This map is cumulative, meaning it shows the accumulation of countries involved in international careers over time.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include international_careers.html %}
</div>

>If you look at the map in 1910, only a few countries are connected. This indicates that actors with international careers originated from and moved to a very limited number of countries. Most of them stayed within countries that share the same language, such as the USA, Great Britain, and Australia, or Argentina and Spain. Others moved to colonies of their home country, such as Great Britain and India. At this time, most involved countries were from the Global North, rich, developed nations (and their colonies).
>
>As time passes, you’ll notice that the number of countries involved in international careers increases, reflecting a growing inclusion of populations in the globalization process. Additionally, the diversity of links between countries expands: the possibilities for international careers become much broader! By 2013, almost all countries were involved in the process, except for many African countries, some Middle Eastern countries, and parts of Central Asia.
>
>Now, let’s compare these results with the **KOF Globalization Index (KOFGI)**. The KOF Globalization Index measures the overall extent of globalization in a country, encompassing economic, social, and political dimensions. It captures the integration of economies, international interactions, and the exchange of ideas and information across borders.

<div style="width: 100%;display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  {% include map_kof.html %}
</div>

>When comparing the two maps, we can observe similarities. Countries strongly involved in international careers, such as the USA and Australia, have high KOF indexes (yellowish on the map), while countries like Chad and Afghanistan, which are not involved in international careers, have low indexes (purple on the map).



# Conclusion {#conclusion}

**Professor:**
>And there you have it, folks! Globalization, as seen through the glamorous (and sometimes overly dramatic) lens of the film industry, is like a blockbuster movie itself, full of unexpected plot twists, star-studded collaborations, and the occasional villain (hello, cultural homogenization).
>
>Economically, the story unfolds with big-budget co-productions and box office revenues skyrocketing across continents. It's as if Hollywood said, "Let’s make the world our stage," and the rest of the planet cautiously joined the cast. Meanwhile, culturally, genres and characters are traveling faster than Marvel's multiverse, creating a delightful mix of cross-border creativity and the occasional "why did they remake that?" moment.
>
>Then we have the population aspect, actors from everywhere playing everywhere, proving that the real stars of globalization aren’t just the James Bonds and Jackie Chans, but the unsung extras who make the magic happen. Sure, some regions are still playing catch-up in the globalization game, but hey, every great movie needs its underdog.
>
>In the end, cinema teaches us a valuable lesson about globalization: it’s messy, uneven, and sometimes overly reliant on sequels, but it’s also vibrant, collaborative, and undeniably human. So, as we roll the credits on this datastory, let’s remember that whether it’s a Bollywood dance sequence or a Hollywood explosion, globalization is a production we’re all part of. \\
